    <h1>Python Comments</h1>
    <p>Comments can be used to explain Python code.

        Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
        
        Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.</p>

    <h2>Multiline Comments</h2>
    <p>Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

        To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

        Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

        Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
        
        As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
        </p>
