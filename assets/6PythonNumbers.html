    <h1>Python Numbers</h1>
    <p>There are three numeric types in Python:</p>

    <h2>Int</h2>
    <p>Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.</p>

    <h2>Float</h2>
    <p>Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.</p>

    <h2>Complex</h2>
    <p>Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:</p>

    <h2>Type Conversion</h2>
    <p>You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:</p>

    <h2>Random Number</h2>
    <p>Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:</p>

    <h2>Random Float</h2>
    <p>The random() method returns a random float number between 0 and 1.</p>

    <h2>Random Integer</h2>
    <p>The randint() method takes two arguments: a lowest and a highest number.</p>

    <h2>Random Choice</h2>
    <p>The choice() method returns a random element from the given sequence.</p>

    <h2>Random Shuffle</h2>
    <p>The shuffle() method takes a sequence (list, string, or tuple) and reorganize the order of the items.</p>

    <h2>Random Sample</h2>
    <p>The sample() method returns a list with a randomly selection of a specified number of items from a sequence.</p>

    <h2>Python Math</h2>
    <p>Python has a set of built-in math functions, including an extensive math module, that allows you to perform mathematical tasks on numbers.</p>

    <h2>Python Math Module</h2>
    <p>Python has also a built-in module called math, which extends the list of mathematical functions.</p>

    <h2>Python Math Functions</h2>
    <p>The min() and max() functions can be used to find the lowest or highest value in an iterable:</p>
