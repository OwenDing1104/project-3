    <h1>Python Syntax</h1>
    <p>The Python syntax defines a set of rules that are used to create a Python Program. The Python Programming Language Syntax has many similarities to Perl, C, and Java Programming Languages. However, there are some definite differences between the languages.</p>

    <h2>Python Intentation</h2>
    <p>Python indentation refers to adding white space before a statement to a particular block of code. In another word, all the statements with the same space to the right, belong to the same code block.</p>
