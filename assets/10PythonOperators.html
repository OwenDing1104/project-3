    <h1>Python Operators</h1>
    <h2>Python Operators</h2>
    <p>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.</p>

    <p>Python divides the operators in the following groups:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Arithmetic operators</li>
        <li>Assignment operators</li>
        <li>Comparison operators</li>
        <li>Logical operators</li>
        <li>Identity operators</li>
        <li>Membership operators</li>
        <li>Bitwise operators</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Python Arithmetic Operators</h2>
    <p>Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:</p>

    <h2>Python Assignment Operators</h2>
    <p>Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:</p>

    <h2>Python Comparison Operators</h2>
    <p>Comparison operators are used to compare two values:</p>

    <h2>Python Logical Operators</h2>
    <p>Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:</p>

    <h2>Python Identity Operators</h2>
    <p>Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:</p>

    <h2>Python Membership Operators</h2>
    <p>Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:</p>

    <h2>Python Bitwise Operators</h2>
    <p>Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:</p>

    <h2>Python Operator Precedence</h2>
    <p>Operator precedence describes the order in which Python executes the arithmetic operators. The following table lists all operators from highest precedence to lowest.</p>
